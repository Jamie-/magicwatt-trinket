# IoT Energy Monitor - Trinket #

Code for the Adafruit Trinket part of my IoT home energy monitor.

Go checkout the main project [here](https://github.com/Jamie-/magicwatt-api) for details about what it's used for.

# Requirements #
You'll need the following libraries to use this. The easiest way to use them is to put all the files detailed here inside the project folder containing the Arduino `.ino` file (you might need to restart the IDE for it to find them after adding them).
* EmonLib - `EmonLib.cpp` & `EmonLib.h` from [here](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/EmonLib)
* TinyWireS - `TinyWireS.cpp`, `TinyWireS.h`, `usiTwiSlave.c` & `usiTwiSlave.h` from [here](https://github.com/rambo/TinyWire)
